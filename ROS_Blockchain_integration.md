# ROS2-Blockchain Integration in Robora

## Overview
This document details how Robora integrates ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) nodes with Ethereum blockchain features, enabling decentralized compute (DePIN), tokenized AI modules, and secure data sharing for modular robots. This hybrid approach allows users to design robots in the 3D builder, export URDF files, and offload tasks (e.g., AI inference) to on-chain nodes while staking $RBR tokens.

As of August 04, 2025, this integration is in early development, with code available in `/robotics/` and `/contracts/`. It demonstrates Robora's viability by showing real code for robotics-blockchain fusion.

## Why Integrate ROS2 with Blockchain?
- **Decentralized Robotics:** ROS2 handles robot control (e.g., motion, vision), while Ethereum manages staking/rewards (e.g., via DePINCompute.sol).
- **Use Cases:** A vision node processes camera data, hashes results on-chain for traceability, or stakes $RBR for compute offload.
- **Benefits:** Privacy (ZK proofs optional), royalties (tokenized modules), scalability (DePIN nodes).

## Architecture
The flow: ROS2 node collects data → Python script calls web3.py → Interacts with Ethereum contract (e.g., submitJob in DePINCompute.sol) → Returns result to node.
